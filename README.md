Tool for finding out which tweet to promote on Twitter
-------------------------------------------------------

This tool was built for the Ads team at VaynerMedia. It looks at the last 200
tweets from brands(managed by VaynerMedia), gives each tweet a score (it's "proprietary"),
and emails the best ones to the team. The mailer is designed to present tweets
that not only have a high score, but are recent. This ensures that tweets that are ready
to be promoted are actually fresh pieces of content followers would want to see.

The app is hosted on Heroku, and runs the mailing tasks daily.
